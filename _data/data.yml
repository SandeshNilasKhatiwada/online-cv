      - role: Jr. Developer
        time: 2023 - Present
        company: Green Byte Technologies
        details: |
          As a Full Stack Intern at Green Byte Technologies, 
          I am actively engaged in a dynamic MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project, 
          contributing to the entire development lifecycle. 
          My key responsibilities include spearheading the development of a web application using the 
          MERN stack, with significant contributions to both frontend and backend components. 
          I am responsible for implementing responsive and user-friendly interfaces with React.js, 
          ensuring an optimal user experience. On the backend, I leverage Node.js and Express.js 
          to develop robust services, including RESTful APIs that facilitate seamless communication
          between the frontend and backend. My role also involves managing the database using MongoDB 
          to design and implement efficient data models, ensuring data integrity and scalability. 
          I actively participate in collaborative coding sessions, team discussions, and agile 
          development practices, which enhance project management and iterative development, ensuring 
          timely and efficient feature delivery. Additionally, I utilize Git for version control, 
          which allows for effective collaboration and management of the codebase.
